We validate the supercritical pitchfork prediction using the symmetry-aware order parameter
M* = E|m(t)|, with aligned means computed from run-wise branch signs. Because of Z2 symmetry, the
signed mixture mean can remain near zero above kappa*; therefore E|m(t)| and RMS(m) are the
primary indicators of symmetry breaking. The scaling exponent
beta_hat = 0.186 (95% CI: [0.173,
0.198], p = 0.0),
estimated for M_corr = sqrt(max(M_abs^2 − M0^2, 0)) in a near-critical window
Δ = (κ−κ*)/κ* ∈ [0.01,
0.05] with n = 9 points,
is compared with the theoretical prediction beta = 0.5. The absence of hysteresis
(p = 0.042) supports supercriticality.
