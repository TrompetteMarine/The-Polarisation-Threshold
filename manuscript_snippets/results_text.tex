We validate the supercritical pitchfork prediction using the variance-based order
parameter $|a^*| = \sqrt{V - V_{\mathrm{baseline}}}$, where $V$ is the population variance and
$V_{\mathrm{baseline}}$ is the minimum variance across the sweep (near $\kappa^*$). This captures polarization amplitude
when the population splits symmetrically into opposing camps. Because of symmetry, the signed mean can
remain near zero above $\kappa^*$; we therefore report $E|m(t)|$ and RMS(m) as primary order parameters.
The scaling exponent
$\hat{\beta} = 3.832$ (95\% CI: $[3.022,
4.642]$, $p = 0.0$)
is consistent with the theoretical prediction $\beta = 0.5$. The absence of hysteresis
($p = 0.019$) supports supercriticality.
